# Chan-Vese Model
A brief review of the Chan-Vese model introduced in the paper [Active Contours Without Edges](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~lvese/PAPERS/IEEEIP2001.pdf) by T. Chan and L. Vese, based on the Mumford–Shah functional using a powerful mathematical backbone, the level set method. Work done as part of the Seminar "[Groundbreaking Ideas in Image Analysis](https://www.mia.uni-saarland.de/Teaching/giia24.shtml)" by Prof. Joachim Weickert in the Universität des Saarlandes.
